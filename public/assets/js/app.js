// NoteTaker Description

// Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and
//  retrieve note data from a JSON file.
    // * The application frontend has already been created, it's your job to build the backend and connect the two.

    // * The application should have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

// * The following API routes should be created:
    //   * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Should recieve a query paramter containing the id of a note to delete. 
    // This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. 
    // In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property,
    //  and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.


//  Acceptance Criteria
    // Application should allow users to view previously saved notes.
    // Application should allow users to delete previously saved notes.


//  Submission on BCS

// You are required to submit the following:
    // * The URL of the deployed application
    // * The URL of the GitHub repository


// *** To Do ****
    // write code to delete previously saved notes.
